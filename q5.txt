let the two ec2 instances to set up passwordless SSH be
34.208.202.82  let this be source server
18.237.45.152  let this be destination server

1. Generate a ssh key pair in source machine using the command

   ssh-keygen -t rsa
2. then enter a password and the path to save the public and private keys

3.  Copy the public key to the destination in a file authorized_key
    in the path /home/ec2-user/.ssh/authorized_keys in 18.237.45.152.
    
    The commands used are
    
    $ mkdir .ssh
    $ cd .ssh
    $ vi authorized_keys
    $ cd .ssh/
    $ cat id_rsa.pub
    
4.  Set the permissions
       700(rwx--) to .ssh folder and
       600(rw--)for authorized_keys file in ssh folder
 
    chmod 700 .ssh/
    chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys
          
5.  Connect from source using private key to destination
      run ssh username@destination
          ssh ec2-user@18.237.45.152
